# global-food-production-dev
This repository contains code and data for an interactive dashboard visualising key insights and trends in global food production over time. The dashboard pulls from an extensive dataset of food production statistics from 1961-2021 across all regions and significant food crop types. It uses compelling data visualisations to highlight changes in crop yields, arable land, regional production, and other dimensions that impact global food security. The goal is to provide a comprehensive perspective into the dynamics shaping our global food systems. Contributors are welcome to submit improvements and additions to the data sources, visualisations, and insights generated through this open-source project. Over time, this can become an invaluable reference tool for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding long-term food production patterns worldwide.
